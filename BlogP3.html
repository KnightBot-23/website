      <div class="section-title"> Where it Started</div>
      <p>
          Music has been my childhood and basically part of my life. It all started when my family really wanted a son who can play an instrument. When my family asked  me about it I thought that playing an instrument was really cool and fun so my mother let me join. This was when it all started and how this encounter made me grow and learn myself.

      <h3> My Violin Years </h3>
      <p> I learned A lot during my 5 years of playing the violin. learning how to read music theory, how to play the violin itself. But there were 3 things that they teach me where it was also applicable to my life this 3 are.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Being patient</li>
        <li>Cooperating with a Group</li>
        <li>Clearminded</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      This Three are the first three things that was taught to me during my first year on  playing violin and to this day I still used this teachings to my life outside of music. <b>Being Patient</b> was the first thing they taught me when i was playing violin. They told me that not everything is going to be easy to learn and how you have to fail and practice to succeed. <b>Cooperating with a group</b> In a band you are working with multiple people. So you have to cooperate and work people to produce a good sound with your group. and last is  being <b>Clearminded</b>, Learning an instrument is all about being clearminded. Learning an instrument is all about muscle memory and always being levelheaded will make you improve faster and play better.</p>
      <h3> My Trumpet Years </h3>
      <p>
      When i got kicked at my violin orchestra due to unfair scenario my family made me join a Marching band. In this i learned more on how to socialize and myself. This are: </p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Burnout</li>
        <li>Confidence</li>
        <li>Encouragement</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
      <b>Burnout</b> during my 10 years of being a member on this band 4 years is me quiting. When it was my 5th year at this band i started talking about quiting to people who i am close with because playing is not really fun anymore and i wanted to do something else and focus on studying. It was also the time covid started so it was basically the perfect time to quit. during those 4 years i started to learn more about myself and started appreciating things more. <b>Confidence</b> being in a marching band needs you to be confident. Because you are basically performing everytime. especially during festivals where everyone expects you to be jolly and exciting. It made me realize that i still need to work on being confident. <b>Encouragement</b> my marching band was very encouraging to me when i started. they said that it was fine to make mistakes and that in this mistakes you learn better and faster. As someone who consider himself a perfectionist it was comforting to hear that and to this day when i make mistakes i never made myself to angry or dissapointed.</p>

    <div class="section-title"> The Present</div>
    <p>
      I honestly think I would have grown up different if I did not joined and learned this two instruments. I sometime think about it as a what if. <b>What if I did not joined  the orchestra?</b>, <b>What if I did not join the Marching Band?</b>. Could I have learned any of this advice?. I always appreciate the people who taught me this instruments and becuase of this instructions I learned from practicing and learning on this two instruments. Is that this teachings are also applicable to my life outside of it. Without this instrument I do not think I would be the same person today.</p>

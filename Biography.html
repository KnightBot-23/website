    I grew up not having the same childhood experience as most Filipinos have. <sup>1</sup> I was a stay at home child basically watching english cartoons all day.<sup>2</sup> When most Filipinos are playing outside, I just watch a lot of cartoons. <sup>3</sup> Back then my  family  wanted me to play an instrument so I started playing violin at the age of 7 in a local orchestra called “musikito”. <sup>4</sup> During this time I went to different parts of the Philippines performing as a 2nd violin player. <sup>5</sup> I fondly remember performing at popular places like CCP. <sup>6</sup>And performing  events including popular actors and actresses back then.<sup>7</sup> One of the most popular actors I performed with is Regine Velasquez.<sup>8</sup> It was during one of her concerts and we were asked to perform one of her background music in one of her songs.<sup>9</sup> I was in musikito for 4-5 years before I got kicked because I could not perform at an event because of a family field trip.<sup>10</sup> I also studied at a private school called Arelliano University but moved to Malabon Elementary School at grade 3 due to financial difficulties.<sup>11</sup> I usually only go outside when I need to go  to school or group practice sessions at my local orchestra. <sup>12</sup> Because of bad experiences of talking to strangers and bullying I got scared talking to strangers.<sup>13</sup> Because of this I started going out less and just watched a lot of youtube and english cartoons.<sup>14</sup> In the present time  a lot of people I know are always shocked that I don't know anything about what is considered childhood for Filipinos.<sup>15</sup> One of the biggest shocks for them is that I don't know anything about  Voltes 5.<sup>16</sup> They consider it as a staple childhood but for me I grew up to more of a western style childhood.<sup>17</sup> That is why when my friends talk about their childhood experiences I am always confused or can’t relate.<sup>18</sup> It takes a while to learn that you grew up very different from the norm.<sup>19</sup> And to this day i still struggle that i am vastly different  when talking to people. <sup>20</sup>

    Teenage year was an afterthought for me.<sup>1</sup>  Before high school I joined a community marching band where I played trumpet while writing this. <sup>2</sup>In a few weeks it will be my 10 year anniversary with this band. <sup>3</sup> The atmosphere in the community band I joined is a lot different compared to when I was in musikito. <sup>4</sup> Of course I was playing a new instrument but with my musical background I never had to relearn the basics and went straight to learning how to play the trumpet. <sup>5</sup> A lot of people in the community band thought my ear was somewhat special. <sup>6</sup> Because  my ear can tell what is wrong really fast and can pick up things really quickly. <sup>7</sup> There was also an age gap here. <sup>8</sup> Back when I was in musikito most of the people i played with were within the same age group. <sup>9</sup> But at my community band I was playing with people who also have their dads playing for 20+ years in this community band. <sup>10</sup> I also played in different areas but it focuses more on festivals and marching which was really fun and tiring.<sup>11</sup> In high school I went to a school called St.James Academy on a nightschool program which is a scholarship program that is sponsored by the DepEd. <sup>12</sup> During this time I never really made friends at my school and in my community band back then it was a lot more serious so I did not really socialize much. <sup>13</sup> St.James is a catholic school which unironically made me confirm to myself that I’m more of an atheist. <sup>14</sup> The upside of this school is that the tuition is free but the downside is that I have 5 years of high school instead of 4. <sup>15</sup> What's frustrating is that after I graduated they suddenly made it 4 years ago so I basically wasted a year. <sup>16</sup> During  this time a year before covid,  I started getting burnt out on playing trumpet. <sup>17</sup> So I made a decision to  leave the community band. <sup>18</sup> I thought back then I was going to leave indefinitely but in 2023 some people asked me if i wanted to practice again which i said sure because it has been a while since i played. <sup>19</sup> Senior High school was not really different. <sup>20</sup> I still  did not socialize much and mostly focused on studying which really made me mentally messed up. <sup>21</sup> Because I always ignored socializing and because of that I was socially awkward and still scared of talking to people. <sup>22</sup>

  <p>
    Before College I made a  rule for myself to be out of my  comfort zone and socialize more. <sup>1</sup> Which  made College  probably the most eventful I have ever been. <sup>2</sup> I was not planning on going to U.E i was thinking of probably going to NU or AdU. <sup>3</sup> But because of my  community band, my friends suggested that I try and audition at a U.E band. <sup>4</sup> Because if I pass the audition I can get a scholarship from the school. <sup>5</sup> I had low expectations because I was rusty and had not played in 4-5 years. <sup>6</sup> I also could not start practicing because I was working on my final research project. <sup>7</sup> So when the audition ended they announced I was actually part of the U.E band. <sup>8</sup> I was surprised and also got a lot of imposter syndrome which took a while to adjust to. <sup>9</sup> During 1st year of college I started talking to people like, like a lot, which made me more social but I realized I am not good at it. <sup>10</sup> I was getting more tired socializing than doing some of my assignments. <sup>11</sup> College  is also a wake up call for me as a student. <sup>12</sup> My mindset has always been that school is all about studying. <sup>13</sup> But it is also about making connections and learning to be more social. <sup>14</sup> It also showcased how draining college is with all the work you have to do to survive. <sup>15</sup> I understand why people say that college is where you truly test your will and also if you truly enjoy the course you took. <sup>16</sup> It  really tackles you to be more out of your comfort zone which is for me something I like and dislike. <sup>17</sup> College is also the way to make connections and truly be out there. <sup>18 </sup>2nd year for me was a lot more difficult than first year because you are losing more free time because work does not help. <sup>19</sup> I have community band practice, U.E band practice and school work balancing all of the same time. <sup>20</sup> But  it's fun and  I am learning to adjust to it. <sup>21</sup>

      Have you ever experienced typing several lines of code just for a simple
      word like <q>Hello World</q> to show up? Or making a simple loop in other
      programming languages feel overcomplicated in Java? Let me tell you about
      the frustration I dealt with while trying to learn Java.

    <p>
      I started learning Java during my first year of college. At first, I thought
      it would be easier than Python because my brother told me,
      <b><q>Java is a lot easier than Python.</q></b>In hindsight, My brother lied to me. The number of rules and methods required to perform simple tasks in Java
overwhelmed me. It took hours just to make simple loops work without errors. Coming from Python made Java feel unnecessarily complex. I was also not in the right mindset at the time. Because when i learn and practice java my mind keeps saying <b><q>This could be a lot less complicated in Python</q></b> or <b><q>I would have done this faster in python</q></b>. Which did not help me learn or even appreciate java.</p>

        I learned that my course is not just about learning. It is all about applying the things you learned and put it in to practice. Java was a harsh reality check for me and showed my weakness on my mindset when it comes to learning and appplying things. With how much i changed sinced the last time i learned java. Maybe I learn java again with a fresh new mindset.

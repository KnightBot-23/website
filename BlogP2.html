      <p>
        I am currently a 2nd year  Computer Science student. And I am at that point where I question what my future would look like. As a reference I always wanted to have what my brother have who graduated studying Computer Science. My brother currently is living well off travelling with his family and is having fun doing what he likes. And because of that I want to have tha lifestyle aswell.

       <div class="section-title"> Future Challenges and Worries</div>
      <p>
        Right now with the rise of <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>. A lot of jobs are currently getting overthrown by AI. I am worried that because of this, job hunting is going to be a lot harder. I have also heard from current graduates struggling to even find jobs because of having impossible job requirments or it being too competitive and saturated. I also think that what if I don't enjoy what I am doing and just wasted my degree doing something I don't enjoy. And there can be hidden problems that could affect my career or even my life could be Sickness,Financial problems and even a War with currently whats happening outside of the Philippines.</p>

      <div class="section-title"> The Dream</div>
      <p>
        My dream as a Computer science  student is  too have a stable enough income that can make me provide financial help to my family in the future. I also want to be at a point where i am financial stable to travel the world while having a job that is fun to do. When you think about the future you always start to worry or overthink but i see as a challenge you have to overcome to achieve this dream. A dream is not something you can achieve overnight,  You have to overcome challenges, Sacrifice stuff to achive your dream. And those challenges and sacrifices is something I have to do to achieve that dream of mine.</p>
